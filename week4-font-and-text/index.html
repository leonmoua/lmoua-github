        going to continue just know that everything you read is just junk and gibberish. I like
        cars. Cars are cool and I think they're a testament to human ingenuity and wisdom. 
        When I'm in a car, I sometimes wonder how our ancestors in the old west journeyed across
        the country with their families, carrying all of their belongings in only a wagon. I can 
        only imagine the amount of frustration and perserverance they must've had to journey that 
        without a car. It also made me realize just how big the Earth is.
